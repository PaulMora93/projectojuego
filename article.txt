In this tutorial using React we will try to implement simple memory game with themes support and some simple animation.
We will try and discuss Create React App 2, React Hooks and styled-components.

// THE DEMO LINK

# Init the App

Let's start creating new CRA project:

// create-react-app memory-game

# Install dependencies

After project creating we can install necessary dependencies:

// cd memory-game
// npm i --save react@16.7.0-alpha.0 react-dom@16.7.0-alpha.0 styled-components ramda

# File structure

I've removed some unnecessary files for this tutorials and have created some new files.
My structure for this moment looks like this:

// screen-2

# App.js

```
https://gist.github.com/ivanicharts/e0861c17c96f76e806b7138123a9c3f1

```

# index.js

```
https://gist.github.com/ivanicharts/7b25cfe8c63a10ce221a01c75732c1f4
```

# index.css

```
https://gist.github.com/ivanicharts/0e95a718fe151f324d0a4f84e3fb6e84
```

Other files are empty. We will fill them below.

# Config

So we have `levels.json` and `themes.json` files for level and theme configurations:

```

```

Here I have 4 level params:

cellCount - the number of cells in a row, for example if 4, then game field size will be 4 x 4
memoryCount - the number of cells that the user will have to remember
fieldSize - size of game field in pixels
space - space between cells
